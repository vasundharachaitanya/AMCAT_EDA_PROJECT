# AMCAT_EDA_PROJECT
# Project Overview:
This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to salaries and various factors influencing them. The objective is to gain insights into the factors affecting salary and to answer specific research questions.

# Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to perform EDA on the dataset to understand the relationships between different variables and salary. Specifically, we aim to explore the distribution of salaries, identify factors influencing salary, and answer specific research questions related to gender and specialization preferences.

# Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information about individuals' salaries, gender, educational background, skills, and other relevant factors. It consists of both numerical and categorical variables, which provide insights into the factors influencing salary levels.

# Approach:
We followed a structured approach to conduct the EDA:

Imported the dataset and performed initial data exploration.
Conducted univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables.
Performed bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns.
Addressed specific research questions related to gender and specialization preferences.
Drew conclusions based on the analysis findings.
# Results:
- Univariate Analysis: We observed that the salary distribution is right-skewed, indicating potential outliers at higher salary levels.
- Bivariate Analysis: There is a positive correlation between education level and salary, with individuals holding higher degrees earning higher salaries. Additionally, we found a significant relationship between gender and specialization preferences.
Research Questions: Our analysis supported the claim that certain specializations, such as Programming Analyst and Software Engineer, are associated with higher salaries for fresh graduates.
# Conclusion:
Through EDA, we gained valuable insights into the factors influencing salary levels and identified patterns and relationships within the dataset. The analysis provides a foundation for further research and can inform decision-making processes related to career choices and salary negotiations.

# Future Work:
Future work could involve exploring additional factors influencing salary, such as job location and industry sector, and conducting predictive modeling to estimate salary levels based on individual characteristics.
